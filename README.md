## Unlock PDF

-  To run the script, make sure you have Node.js installed along with the pdf-lib library. You can install pdf-lib using npm
```
npm install @pdf-lib/pdf-lib
```
- Then save the above script to a file (e.g., unlock_pdf.js) and run it from the command line like this

```
node unlockpdf.js input.pdf password output.pdf
```

- Replace input.pdf with the path to your password-protected PDF file, password with the actual password, and output.pdf with the desired name for the unlocked PDF file.
